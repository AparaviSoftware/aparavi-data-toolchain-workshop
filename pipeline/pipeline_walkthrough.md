# Aparavi AI Chatbot Pipeline ‚Äì Step-by-Step Walkthrough

This guide explains each stage of the Aparavi Enterprise Chatbot Pipeline. Whether you're following along with the workshop or importing the pipeline into your own environment, this walkthrough will help you understand how each step transforms your unstructured data into an AI-ready chatbot.

## üõ† Pipeline Overview

### Pipeline Steps:
1. Data Ingestion
2. Classification
3. Anonymization
4. Vectorization
5. Chatbot Connection (Gemini LLM)

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion

**Purpose:** Bring in your unstructured data from multiple enterprise sources into Aparavi's environment so it can be processed and analyzed.

**Details:**
* **Sources Supported:** SharePoint, Teams, local file servers, or any connected cloud storage.
* **Options:** Include subfolders, filter by file types (docs, PDFs, emails, etc.)
* **Result:** All selected data is consolidated into a single processing workspace.

**Pro Tip:** Start with a small subset of data to ensure the pipeline runs smoothly before scaling to large datasets.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Classification

**Purpose:** Automatically categorize your data to make it searchable and AI-ready.

**Details:**
* **Model Used:** `aparavi-default`
* **Functionality:** Detects document types, topics, and key content areas.
* **Outcome:** Each piece of content is tagged with structured metadata for downstream processing.

**Pro Tip:** You can customize classification rules if your organization uses specific taxonomies.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Anonymization

**Purpose:** Securely remove sensitive information from your dataset before AI processing.

**Details:**
* **Method:** PII scrubbing (masking personally identifiable information)
* **Mask Strategy:** Entity-based, meaning names, emails, phone numbers, and other identifiers are anonymized.
* **Outcome:** Safe, clean data ready for embedding and AI queries.

**Pro Tip:** Always review anonymized outputs for compliance in regulated industries ‚Äî Aparavi's tool gives you full visibility into what was masked.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Vectorization

**Purpose:** Convert your textual data into vector embeddings for semantic search and AI reasoning.

**Details:**
* **Provider:** Weaviate
* **Embedding Model:** `text-embedding-004`
* **Outcome:** Each document is transformed into high-dimensional vectors, enabling fast, context-aware retrieval by the chatbot.

**Pro Tip:** Use vectorization to enable RAG-style AI responses, where the chatbot can answer questions based on your actual data rather than generic knowledge.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Chatbot Connection (Gemini LLM)

**Purpose:** Connect your vectorized dataset to an AI model to create an interactive chatbot.

**Details:**
* **LLM:** Google Gemini
* **Context Source:** Weaviate embeddings
* **Temperature:** 0.7 (controls creativity in responses)
* **Outcome:** Your chatbot can answer questions, summarize information, and provide insights based on your enterprise data.

**Pro Tip:** Start by asking broad questions to validate knowledge coverage, then refine prompts for specific workflows.
