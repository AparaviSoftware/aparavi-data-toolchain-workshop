## Incident Description

On November 8, 2024, Eric posted content to NexTech's official LinkedIn company page that had not been reviewed or approved through the standard content approval workflow. The post contained:

1. Inaccurate product information (claimed features that are not yet available)
2. A pricing error (stated $199/month instead of $299/month)
3. Grammatical errors and typos

The post received significant engagement before the error was discovered 4 hours later. Marketing leadership had to issue a correction and apologize to confused prospects.

## Investigation Summary

**Interviewed Parties:**
- Eric Young (Employee)
- Laura Hill (Marketing Manager, Direct Supervisor)
- Rachel Kim (VP of Sales - reported initial concern)

**Findings:**

Eric acknowledged that he bypassed the content approval process because he was "trying to be more proactive" and "thought it was a simple post." He stated he didn't realize the information was incorrect and "just grabbed details from an old draft."

This is Eric's first policy violation. His overall performance has been acceptable, though he's received feedback previously about attention to detail and following established processes.

The incident caused:
- Confusion among 47 prospects who inquired about the incorrect pricing
- 3 hours of sales team time responding to inquiries
- Minor damage to brand credibility
- Need for public correction post

## Manager Statement

"Eric is an enthusiastic team member who genuinely wants to contribute, but he sometimes moves too quickly without following established processes. This incident, while concerning, appears to stem from overenthusiasm rather than malicious intent or laziness. With clearer guidelines and more structured oversight, I believe Eric can succeed in this role. However, attention to detail and process adherence are non-negotiable in marketing, especially for public-facing content."

**- Laura Hill, Marketing Manager**

---

## Employee Statement

"I understand that I made a mistake by posting without going through the approval process. I was trying to help by being proactive, but I realize now that these processes exist for good reasons. I should have taken more time to verify the information and follow the standard workflow. I'm committed to being more careful and following all processes going forward."

**- Eric Young, Content Marketing Specialist**

## HR Review

This verbal warning with documentation is appropriate given this is Eric's first policy violation and the relatively minor nature of the impact (no major financial loss or compliance violation). However, the marketing department's public-facing role requires strict adherence to approval processes.

HR will check in at 30 days to confirm successful completion of corrective action requirements.
