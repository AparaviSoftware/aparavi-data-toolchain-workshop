Laura has done an exceptional job building our marketing function essentially from scratch. She's strategic, creative, and execution-focused - a rare combination. The marketing foundation she's built positions us well for scale. As we grow, Laura will need to transition from doing everything herself to building and leading a team, which I'm confident she can do.
