## Overall Rating: Below Expectations (2.5/5)

## Summary

Andrew joined NexTech in August 2024 and has shown adequate technical skills but has struggled with customer communication and meeting commitments. This review covers his first 4.5 months and outlines clear expectations for improvement.

## Key Accomplishments

### Technical Demonstrations
- Delivered 23 product demonstrations to prospective customers
- Created 2 custom demo environments for complex use cases
- Technical knowledge of product is solid and improving

### Training Completion

- Obtained NexTech Product Certification

## Areas Requiring Immediate Improvement

### Professionalism & Communication
- **Late to meetings:** 12 instances of arriving 10+ minutes late to customer calls (unacceptable)
- **Missed commitments:** 7 instances of failing to follow up with promised information to customers
- **Response time:** Average email response time of 36 hours (target: 4 hours for customer inquiries)
- **Documentation:** Frequently fails to log customer interactions in CRM

### Sales Support
- Contributed to only 2 closed deals (below team average of 5 for this time period)
- Feedback from Account Executives indicates inconsistent support
- Technical win rate on deals Andrew supported: 40% (team average: 72%)

### Accountability
- Requires frequent reminders to complete tasks
- Makes excuses rather than owning mistakes
- Defensive when receiving constructive feedback

## Customer Feedback

Two customers specifically mentioned concerns about Andrew's responsiveness and follow-through:
- "We had to ask three times for the architecture diagram that was promised"
- "The demo was good but we never received answers to our security questions"

## Performance Improvement Plan - Required

Due to performance below expectations, Andrew is being placed on a 60-day Performance Improvement Plan with the following requirements:

### Professional Conduct (Must Achieve):
1. **Zero tardiness:** Arrive on time or early to all meetings
2. **24-hour response time:** Respond to all customer emails within 24 business hours
3. **Complete follow-ups:** 100% completion rate on promised customer deliverables within committed timeframe
4. **CRM compliance:** Log all customer interactions within 24 hours

### Sales Contribution (Must Achieve):
1. Support at least 4 opportunities to close by March 15, 2025
2. Achieve technical win rate of 65%+ on supported deals
3. Receive positive feedback from at least 3 Account Executives on collaboration

### Accountability & Growth:
1. Weekly 1:1s with manager (mandatory attendance)
2. Shadow 3 senior sales engineers on customer calls
3. Complete "Customer Communication Excellence" training
4. Demonstrate receptiveness to feedback without defensiveness

### Consequences:
Failure to meet these requirements will result in termination of employment. Progress will be reviewed bi-weekly.

## Compensation

- **Current Salary:** $135,000
- **No salary increase** due to performance concerns
- **No 2024 bonus** (below expectations rating)
- **Commission:** Only earned commission on 2 closed deals: $8,100

## Manager Comments

Andrew has technical aptitude but is not meeting professional standards for the role. Customer-facing positions require exceptional communication, reliability, and accountability - areas where Andrew is currently falling short. This is a critical development period. I need to see immediate and sustained improvement in professionalism and customer service.

**If Andrew successfully completes the PIP, we can reassess his performance in March 2025. Without significant improvement, this role is not the right fit.**
