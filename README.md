# Build Your AI Chatbot Workshop

Welcome to the **Build Your AI Chatbot** workshop repo — your hands-on guide to turning forgotten, unstructured data into an intelligent, secure, Gemini-powered chatbot.

Most enterprises only use a fraction of their data for AI — leaving insights, ROI, and competitive advantage behind. In this workshop, we built an **enterprise-grade chatbot** that actually leverages your full dataset — securely, cleanly, and without writing a single line of code.

This repo is a companion to the live session. It includes everything you need to **rebuild, customize, and scale** what we covered.

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn
Together we covered how to:
- Ingest and classify unstructured data from multiple sources
- Anonymize and clean sensitive information (PII, credentials, etc.)
- Vectorize data for semantic search and contextual chat
- Connect your dataset directly to **Gemini** using **Aparavi’s Data Toolchain for AI**
- Deploy a working chatbot that understands your enterprise content

## 🛠 Quick Start

### 1. Import the pipeline
Use the provided JSON under [`pipeline/aparavi_chatbot_pipeline.json`](pipeline/aparavi_chatbot_pipeline.json) to import the workflow directly into your Aparavi environment.

### 2. Connect data & credentials
You can use:
- Your own enterprise data (SharePoint, Teams, file servers, etc.)
- Or our sample dataset under `/data/sample_unstructured_files/`

### 3. Run the pipeline
Watch as your unstructured data is parsed, anonymized, embedded into Weaviate, and connected to Gemini — giving you a working chatbot in minutes.

## 💡 Why This Matters
AI isn’t just about models — it’s about **data readiness**.  
Aparavi helps you turn messy, unstructured data into clean, structured, and AI-ready assets that can be safely leveraged for enterprise use.

You now have the blueprint to:
- Reduce time-to-value for AI initiatives  
- Unlock ROI from existing information assets  
- Build secure, scalable AI pipelines without code
