# Workshop Recap & Key Learnings

## 🔍 What We Built
During the **Build Your AI Chatbot** workshop, we walked through how to take unstructured enterprise data and turn it into a working chatbot — all using Aparavi’s Data Toolchain.

### Pipeline Overview
1. **Data Ingestion** — Gathered files from multiple sources (SharePoint, Teams, local storage)
2. **Classification** — Used Aparavi’s engine to tag and categorize the data
3. **Anonymization** — Automatically scrubbed sensitive PII
4. **Vectorize & Chat** — Embedded clean data into **Weaviate** for semantic search
5. **Gemini LLM** — Connected Google’s Gemini model for contextual chat and reasoning

The result? A secure, no-code chatbot powered by your own enterprise data.
